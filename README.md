A Web App that helps you set SMART goals, and track them to completion, along with other self-improvement features that will help anyone Ascend into their fullest potential.

### This Web Application will allow the user to: 
1. Create SMART Goals that align with the users core values. 
  * There will be a default list of Core Values as well as the ability to add more. Core Value Examples: Career, Education, Personal Finance, Friends/Family, etc. 
  * When a user creates a goal, they will input the name of the goal (S), how they will know the goal is completed (M), rate how challenging the goal will be for them (A), what core value the goal aligns with (R), select a specefic date from a Calendar when the goal can be achieved (T), as well as additional inputs like any challenges they are concerned about and how they will handle them. This advice can be used as a helpful reminder during rough times. 
  
2. Input Tasks and Sub-Tasks that lead to the goal completion

3. Log the progress made on all goals and present the data in an easy to read graph. 

4. Share a goal's Tasks or Progress with someone else to help with Accountability, have a mentor review the tasks, or collaborate with someone whop shares the same goal. 

5. Log BucketList Items
  * Bucket list Items are longer term aspirations that the user is not ready to make into goals yet. Ex.) Retire at the age of 40, thru-hike the Appalachian trail, etc. 
  * To Create a Bucket list item the user will enter in similar inputs at that for the goals. 
  * Bucketlist items will be added to their own seperate section to keep them on the users radar
  * Bucketlist items can later be converted to goals easily. 

6. Insert a Journal entry to track any challenges or downfalls. The user can review these later and write how they were able to overcome these challenges. 
7. Use logic to make a difficult decision. 
  * User will be asked to enter each thing they are having difficulty deciding between. ex.) a list of universities to attend
  * User will be asked to list the pros and cons of each.
  * User will be asked to rank from 1 to 10 how much they value each pro for each option. 
  * A value will be computed to determine the best option based on what the user values most. 

### Other features will be added over time, the app will be built to expand with ease.
